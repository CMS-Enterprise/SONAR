# Automatic deployment pipeline trigger jobs for lower realms.
# These must all be run serially! Each triggered pipeline pushes a commit to the same branch
# of the Sonar manifests repo. If they ran in parallel starting at the same time (thus, with
# the same initial commit ref for the branch), after one of them pushes it's commit successfully,
# all others would fail because they don't have the new commit from the first one. It'd be like a
# bunch of devs pushing conflicting updates to the same code without rebasing/syncing each others
# changes, someone will always get a merge conflict.

# Deployment pipeline trigger jobs for the upper realms; automatic deployment for test, manual for prod.
# These must also be run serially, for the same reasons as the lower realms! However, these jobs run
# under different conditions (orthogonal to the lower realm conditions) and don't depend on the lower
# realm jobs; they form a different "chain" of deployments.
