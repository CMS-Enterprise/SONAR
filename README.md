# SONAR

SONAR is an API endpoint and dashboard UI for monitoring the health of both BatCAVE core services and BatCAVE deployed applications. SONAR actively monitors and records the health of services running in BatCAVE using a combination of Prometheus queries (for checks of system and application metrics), Loki queries (for checks of log messages), HTTP/S status code checks, DNS checks, and TLS certificate checks.
